# API

## Conventions

* Root resource names are plural
  * Related resources being acted on via a root resource are singular
    * e.x. `surveys/node`
* Resource updates are performed via `POST` with JSON input bodies
  * Avoid using URL query parameters
* Verb actions that update flag-type states can be included under resources
    * e.x. `node/publish`

## Users

---

`GET /users`  - return all users. *This should not be implemented or only at super admin*

`PUT /users/:id` - update single user info

`POST /users` - create a new user, needs to be coordinated with Cognito process
